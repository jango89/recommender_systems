Recommendation system Backend for Heriot Watt PG Course.

This is an open source project which i am planning to do for helping students to find the most suitable courses for their Post Graduation.
Right now the project is completely focussed on Heriot Watt University, as i did my PG from there :)

However I wanted to completely automate this process for maximum number of universities all around the world.

The application runs as an Spring boot REST API application which indexes data to elasticsearch and works out the recommendations 
from Elasticsearch.
